## Features

- Real-time clipboard synchronization across devices
- Secure data transmission with HTTPS

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S csync-release
```

### macOS (homebrew)

```bash

```

## Usage

Csync has 3 binary files:

- `csync-server`: A HTTP(S) server to save and exchange clipboard data. All devices should be able to access it.
- `csyncd`: A daemon to access system clipboard manager and synchronous with other devices. It will also start a system tray GUI to view clipboard history.
- `csynctl`: A command to control csync server. You can use this command to read/write clipboard data, manage server RBAC, etc.

Please refer to `<cmd> --help` for more usage.

## Security

Since csync transmits clipboard data over the network, security is a top priority. The following security measures are implemented:

- HTTPS support for secure server communication
- Token-based authentication
